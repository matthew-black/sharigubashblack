        <p>If your life has felt unbalanced and off-course, your relationships have felt unsatisfying, or you’ve had experiences
        that have silenced your voice and injured your spirit, therapy can help.</p>
        <p>As a psychologist, I provide therapy to individuals who deeply care about creating a life aligned with their values and
        sense of self. I can help you understand yourself more fully and increase your self-compassion, collaborating to develop
        new ways of thinking or acting that fit with who you are. My therapeutic approach includes the belief that relationships
        are an innate part of the healing process, and that positive relationships generate energy to transform lives.</p>

        <p>Hi. I'm Shari (she/her). I am a Licensed Psychologist grounded in the arts and education community—in addition to advanced graduate degrees in
        psychology, I hold bachelor's degrees in English and Theater. I have received training in a number of therapeutic
        approaches, including interpersonal process and relational therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and dialectical
        behavioral therapy. This intensive training and creative background has resulted in my taking an integrative approach to
        therapy based on client need.</p>
        <p>I consider therapy an art form based in science, and infuse humor, creativity, and a sense
        of playfulness into my sessions. I have over 10 years of experience serving diverse individuals, couples, and groups
        in a number of settings. I completed my doctoral psychology internship at the Colorado State University Health Network
        and specialize in working with university students and recent graduates.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy curling up with a good book, contributing to the high notes in a local vocal ensemble, and
        sewing historical costumes with a twist.</p>

        <p class="question">How do I get started?</p>
        <p>The first step to beginning therapy is a free 15-minute phone consultation. An initial consultation can be helpful
          even
          if you are just curious about mental health treatment and would like to ask questions to better understand the
          therapy
          process. During this conversation, my goal is for both of us to assess whether we would be a good fit for therapy. I
          work to understand what you are hoping to get out of therapy, and if my skills and training can help you along your
          journey. This is also your opportunity to get a sense of my therapeutic approach and answers to any questions you
          might
          have.</p>
        <p>To set up a consultation, feel free to contact me via phone or email:</p>

        <p>I am currently an in-network provider with Blue Cross Blue Shield. I also see clients using direct pay or out-of-network benefits.
        You are responsible for full payment at the time of our session if you are using out-of-network
        benefits. Be sure to check with your insurance provider to know your reimbursement—it is your responsibility to fully
        understand your coverage.</p>

        <h5 class="surprising-subheading">Your Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills (OMB Control Number: 0938-1401)</h5>
        <p>When you get emergency care or get treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from surprise billing or balance billing.</p>

        <h5 class="surprising-subheading">What is “Balance Billing” (Sometimes Called “Surprise Billing”)?</h5>
        <p>When you see a doctor or other health care provider, you may owe certain out-of-pocket costs,  such as a copayment, coinsurance, and/or a deductible. You may have other costs or have to pay the entire bill if you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn’t in your health plan’s network.</p>
        <p>“Out-of-network” describes providers and facilities that haven’t signed a contract with your health plan. Out-of-network providers may be permitted to bill you for the difference between what your plan agreed to pay and the full amount charged for a service. This is called “balance billing.” This amount is likely more than in-network costs for the same service and might not count toward your annual out-of-pocket limit.</p>
        <p>“Surprise billing” is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can’t control who is involved in your care - like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an in-network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network provider.</p>
        
        <h5 class="surprising-subheading">You Are Protected From Balance Billing for:</h5>
          <p class="question">Emergency Services:</p>
          <p>If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an out-of-network provider or facility, the most the provider or facility may bill you is your plan’s in-network cost-sharing amount (such as copayments and coinsurance). You can’t be balance billed for these emergency services. This includes services you may get after you’re in stable  condition unless you give written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post-stabilization services.</p>
          <p class="question">Certain Services at an In-Network Hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center:</p>
          <p>When you get services from an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, certain providers there may be out-of-network. In these cases, the most those providers may bill you is your plan’s in-network cost-sharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services. These providers can’t balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections  not to be balance billed.</p>
          <p>If you get other services at these in-network facilities, out-of-network providers can’t balance  bill you unless you give written consent and give up your protections.</p>
          <p>You’re never required to give up your protection from balance billing. You also aren’t required to get care out-of-network. You can choose a provider or facility in your plan’s network.</p>
          <p class="question">When Balance Billing Isn’t Allowed, You Also Have the Following Protections:</p>
          <p>You are only responsible for paying your share of the cost (like the copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles that you would pay if the provider or facility was in-network). Your health plan will pay out-of-network providers and facilities directly.</p>
          <p>Your health plan generally must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cover emergency services without requiring you to get approval for services in advance (prior authorization).</li>
            <li>Cover emergency services by out-of-network providers.</li>
            <li>Base what you owe the provider or facility (cost-sharing) on what it would pay an in-network provider or facility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits.</li>
            <li>Count any amount you pay for emergency services or out-of-network services toward your deductible and out-of-pocket limit.</li>
          </ul>
