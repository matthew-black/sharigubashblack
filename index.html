        <p>If your life has felt unbalanced and off-course, your relationships have felt unsatisfying, or you’ve had experiences
        that have silenced your voice and injured your spirit, therapy can help.</p>
        <p>As a psychologist, I provide therapy to individuals who deeply care about creating a life aligned with their values and
        sense of self. I can help you understand yourself more fully and increase your self-compassion, collaborating to develop
        new ways of thinking or acting that fit with who you are. My therapeutic approach includes the belief that relationships
        are an innate part of the healing process, and that positive relationships generate energy to transform lives.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="seven columns">
        <p>I am a Licensed Psychologist grounded in the arts and education community—in addition to advanced graduate degrees in
        psychology, I hold bachelor's degrees in English and Theater. I have received training in a number of therapeutic
        approaches, including interpersonal process and relational therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and dialectical
        behavioral therapy. This intensive training and creative background has resulted in my taking an integrative approach to
        therapy based on client need.</p>
        <p>I consider therapy an art form based in science, and infuse humor, creativity, and a sense
        of playfulness into my sessions. I have over eight years of experience serving diverse individuals, couples, and groups
        in a number of settings. I completed my doctoral psychology internship at the Colorado State University Health Network
        and specialize in working with university students and recent graduates.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy curling up with a good book, contributing to the high notes in a local vocal ensemble, and
        sewing historical costumes with a twist.</p>

        <p class="question">How do I get started?</p>
        <p>The first step to beginning therapy is a free 15 minute phone consultation. An initial consultation can be helpful
          even
          if you are just curious about mental health treatment and would like to ask questions to better understand the
          therapy
          process. During this conversation, my goal is for both of us to assess whether we would be a good fit for therapy. I
          work to understand what you are hoping to get out of therapy, and if my skills and training can help you along your
          journey. This is also your opportunity to get a sense of my therapeutic approach and answers to any questions you
          might
          have.</p>
        <p>To set up a consultation, feel free to contact me via phone or email:</p>

        <p class="question">Do you take insurance?</p>
        <p>I am in the process of finalizing insurance contracts. Until then, I am seeing clients using direct pay or
        out-of-network benefits. You are responsible for full payment at the time of our session if you are using out-of-network
        benefits. Be sure to check with your insurance provider to know your reimbursement—it is your responsibility to fully
        understand your coverage.</p>
